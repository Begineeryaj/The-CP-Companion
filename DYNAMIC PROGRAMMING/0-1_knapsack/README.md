> Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

- INPUT : you are given maximum capacity W, weight array wt[], value array val[], and the number of items n as a parameter.

- OUTPUT: Output the maximum possible value you can get.

> INPUT : N = 3
          W = 4
          values[] = {1,2,3}
          weight[] = {4,5,1}

> OUTPUT :  3

- EXPLAINATION :  
        
        We can anytime take maximum weight  = 4. So, the possibilities are taking {4} and {1} weights, so the corresponding maximum profit can be 1 or 3. So the maximum profit = 3.
